# iChing-Hexagram-Generator

The iChing is one of the oldest known books, and is the oldest known method of divination. Using it requires a method of casting to create a hexagram, and then looking that up in the iChing('Book Of Changes') to read the passage returned.

One popular method is casting 3 coins 6 separate times to generate the hexagram, but this statistically leads to different results than the tradition Yarrow Stick method.

This program was created based on the statistical likelyhood of returning a line based on the Yarrow Stick method.

Not only will this program cast for you, it will also webscrape entries from https://divination.com/iching, and return your reading right in your terminal. From divination.com,

"The I Ching, or “Book of Changes,” consists of sixty-four archetypes that result from all the possible six-line combinations of yin and yang lines, called hexagrams. Yin/yang is the fundamental duality of the Universe whose dynamic tension gives shape to all phenomena and the way they change. Examples of yin/yang polarity are female/male, earth/heavens, dark/light, in/out, even/odd and so on."
